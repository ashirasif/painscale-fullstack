# Painscale FullStack

This is a full-stack version of painscale app to showcase the backend a bit better.

## Primary Focus:

The primary focus is to showcase asynchronous operations in javascript. In this example, I have used both `.then()` convention (onSubmit of form), and `async await` syntax (deleteSubmission of submissions.tsx), 
made this into a somewhat practical application. I'll be waiting for your feedback!

## What It Uses:
 - express with typescript
 - vite
 - react + typescript
 - sqlite3 (in memory only)

## How To Run:
 - Clone the repo
 - ```
   cd server
   pnpm install
   npx ts-node server.ts
   ```
 - open another terminal and cd to repo's dir
 - ```
   cd painscale
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```
